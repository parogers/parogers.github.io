Design
------

The demo is a side scrolling action game with fantasy elements. The art
style is "stripped down 8-bit" mostly because it was easy to knock something 
together without worrying too much about design.

* Randomly generated levels
* Area by area level progression
* Difficulty progression
* Music (single track)
* Sound effects
* Two weapon types: sword, bow
* Enemies: snake, scorpion, rate, goblin, skeleton warrior, ghost
* Sword upgrades
* Armour upgrades
* Basic inventory
* Keyboard controls
* Touch controls (on-screen controller for mobile)

Screens:

* Title (showing credits etc)
* Gameplay (level-by-level play)
* Gameover (summary of kills)
